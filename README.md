## For Developers

Developers can start a development of Remap locally by the following step:

1. Install NodeJS version 12 or higher.
2. Install `yarn` command with `npm install -g yarn`.
3. Run `yarn install`.
4. Run `yarn start`.
5. Open the `http://localhost:3000` in the Chrome or Edge Stable 89 or higher.

As a limitation, the launched Remap locally cannot access to Firebase backend server. Therefore, the developer needs to import a keyboard definition JSON file from local every times at opening a keyboard.
